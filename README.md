## Week3

Welcome to my week3 branch.
+ Sorry, couldn't clean up my code this week.
+ Type from root directory to enter the proper pip environment.

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
Check that more than 2 packages are installed with:

```bash
pip3 list
```

If this is not the case, do the following below. You can also do this if you want to make your own conda env.

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

Since the packages for this week are lightweight,
you can make a virtual environment with venv instead of conda.
 

### Testing the Decision Tree Classifier

+ Couldn't create random data
+ Just tested w/ our data.


### Intruder messengers and receivers

+ The broker is virtual, so you can run both scripts in parallel.
+ Two separate windows or two separate panes on a terminal multiplexer will properly listen and receive.
+ Right now, the messenger will send the integer you input with standard input.
+ The receiver will output what it will send to the Raspberry Pi
